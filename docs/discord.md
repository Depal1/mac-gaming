# Discord installation

Date: March 4, 2022

As of March 4, 2022, Discord's regular release does not support Apple Silicon natively.

You can obtain the regular Discord release with

```
brew install --cask discord
```

For better performance on Apple Silicon you will need Discord Canary. This one does support the ARM architecture natively.

```
brew tap cask-versions/discord-canary
```
