# Enabling the DXVK HUD on Crossover
  1. Open the CrossOver app and right click on the bottle you want the DXVK HUD for. (You will need DXVK enabled, and this will only work on DX10+ games)

  2. Press Open C: Drive.

  3. Once in finder press Command+Up (without the +).

  4. There should be a file called cxbottle.conf, open it with text edit

  5. Locate to the very end of the file, and copy and paste this text with the apostrophes `"DXVK_HUD"="full"`. Save the file.

  6. Exit out of finder.

  7. Restart the bottle.

  8. Now the DXVK HUD is enabled.

Notes:
If you are using a DX10+ game and the HUD is enabled, but it doesn't come up, this means that you either didn't enable DXVK or the DXVK HUD itself.
If you want to get back the orginal DXVK back disable then enable it again in the CrossOver settings.
